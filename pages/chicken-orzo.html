        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>Smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 cup orzo </li>
            <li>minced garlic</li>
            <li> 10 oz sliced cherry tomatoes sliced in half</li>
            <li>5 oz fresh spinach</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup basil pesto</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice chicken breasts into thinner strips. Generously season the chicken with smoked paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a large, high-sided, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add chicken. Cook the chicken on medium heat for about 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
            <li>To the same, now empty, skillet, add 1 cup of uncooked orzo, 5 cloves of minced garlic, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook the orzo on medium heat, stirring, for about 2 minutes until browned.</li>
            <li>Add 2 cups of chicken stock, half of the cherry tomatoes, and Â¼ teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for about 5 or 10 minutes, occasionally stirring to prevent the orzo from sticking to the bottom of the pan, until the orzo is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add spinach and the remaining cherry tomatoes. Stir everything on low-medium heat until the spinach wilts.</li>
            <li>Add heavy cream and basil pesto to the skillet with orzo and veggies and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, if desired.</li>
            <li>Return the chicken to the skillet. Allow the chicken to simmer in the sauce to heat through and until the chicken is completely cooked through.</li>
